# 🕒 Current Project Status: Auto-Short-Factory

> **Date:** 2026-01-22
> **Version:** 1.0.0
> **Status:** Active / Phase 9 (API & Dashboard Integration)

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

The system is a **Turborepo monorepo** designed for high-volume, AI-driven video production.

| Layer | Component | Status | Technology |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Orchestration** | `apps/orchestrator` | ✅ Prod-Ready | Node.js (TS) |
| **AI Processing** | `apps/ai-logic` | ✅ Prod-Ready | Python, Gemini 1.5 Flash |
| **Video Rendering** | `apps/video-engine` | ✅ Prod-Ready | Python, FFmpeg 6.0 |
| **Persistence** | `@repo/database` | ✅ Prod-Ready | Prisma, PostgreSQL |
| **Public API** | `apps/api` | 🚧 In Progress | NestJS |
| **Dashboard** | `apps/web` | 🚧 In Progress | Next.js, UI Components |

## 🚀 Accomplishments (Phases 1-8)

- **Scalable Pipeline**: Successfully integrated Gemini 1.5 Flash for script generation and FFmpeg for automated video assembly.
- **Production Hardening**: implemented database persistence, multi-key rotation for Gemini, and Google Sheets logging for auditability.
- **Automation**: GitHub Actions workflow enabled for hourly automated video generation.

## 🚧 Current focus (Phase 9)

We are currently building the **Management Layer** to transition from a CLI/Automation-only tool to a full-featured SaaS-ready platform:

1.  **API Layer (`apps/api`)**: Exposing internal workflows via REST/WebSockets.
2.  **Dashboard (`apps/web`)**: building a visual "Jobs Board" for monitoring and managing video generation.
3.  **Deployment**: Transitioning to a containerized (Docker) architecture for all services.

## 📊 Business Context

The project is positioned to capture value in:
- **Niche Content Farming**: Rapidly launching and maintaining 50+ social channels.
- **Agency Tooling**: Providing high-volume content services to businesses with minimal overhead.
- **SaaS**: Selling video generation credits to individual creators.

## ⚠️ Key Risks & Mitigations

- **Platform Filters**: Algorithms detecting AI content. *Mitigation: Human-in-the-loop review and premium asset integration.*
- **Rendering Latency**: FFmpeg is CPU-heavy. *Mitigation: Designing for horizontal scaling of Video Engine instances.*
- **Operational Complexity**: Multi-runtime (Node + Python) environment. *Mitigation: Standardized Dockerization and CI/CD.*
