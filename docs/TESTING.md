# 🧪 Testing Strategy: Auto-Short-Factory

This document outlines the testing standards and procedures for the Auto-Short-Factory monorepo.

## 🏹 Testing Goals

1.  **Reliability**: Ensure the AI orchestration and video rendering pipeline works as expected.
2.  **Maintenance**: Allow safe refactoring of shared packages and services.
3.  **Speed**: Use fast testing frameworks (Jest/Vitest) to provide quick feedback.

## 🏗️ Testing Stack

| Layer | Framework | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Public API** | Jest | Unit & Integration testing of NestJS logic. |
| **Web Dashboard** | Vitest | Unit testing of frontend utilities and components. |
| **Shared Packages** | Jest | Testing of shared config, types, and database logic. |

## 🚀 Running Tests

### All Packages (Turborepo)
Run all tests across the entire monorepo with intelligent caching:
```bash
pnpm run test
```

### Individual Package
```bash
cd apps/api
pnpm run test
```

## 📝 Best Practices

- **Mocking**: Mock external services (S3, Gemini, Google Sheets) to keep tests fast and isolated.
- **Naming**: Use `.spec.ts` for unit tests.
- **CI/CD**: Tests are automatically run on every Pull Request via GitHub Actions.
